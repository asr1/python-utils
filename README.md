# python-utils

python utilities for file management

* pdf2img: takes one page and splits every page to a new image
* pdfsplit: splits a pdf based on a range (e.g. taking the last two pages of a pdf)
* pdf_margins: adds margins around a pdf.pdf_margins_4e: as above, but with defaults for the 4e d&d character builder
* video_convert: converts a video from one import format to another
* vote: use selenium to click a button on a website repeatedly. Used for popularity contests
* weddingCrawler: uses selenium to crawl my wedding photographer's site and download every thumbnail so I can look through them using keyboard shortcuts.

## Improvements

* Take command line arguments on all utils (only margins has this today).
* video_convert should specify all supported formats (everything moviepy supports)
* add requirements.txt
